# the following variables are depricated and should not be used anymore:
# @PROJECT_NAME@_LIBRARIES
# @PROJECT_NAME@_INCLUDES

# instead, just directly link the library @PROJECT_NAME@ to your executable target like this:
#
# TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(YourExecutableTarget @PROJECT_NAME@)
#
# (all the includes and additional libraries are automatically determined from the target @PROJECT_NAME@)
